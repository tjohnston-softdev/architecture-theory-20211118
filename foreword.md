# Foreword

The assessment was originally given as a Google Doc which the interviewer and I went through together. His process was that first we have an informal discussion about what the answers *might* be, and then give me time to actually get my thoughts together and write something down. Software architecture is something I have no formal training in so the questions did throw me off a little. Luckily, the interviewer understood when I explained that to him. We considered that perhaps the wording of the question was a little off and that I may have learned about these things under different terminoligy. Doing some research later on helped me relate these questions back to my own experiences...and learn some things along the way.

For my submitted answers, I would start with the 'textbook' information that anybody can retrieve from Google. Then I would describe my personal experience and prior knowledge of the concepts at hand.
